## Git beyond the basics

Katja: I have started to prepare some material that I'm going to use for a Git workshop in October 2016. It is picking up the idea from the OpenTechSchool tutorial on git, to add local pubs and cafes to a directory.

Tim: I have made changes to the instructions for clarification, including the answers. Look in the docs dir for more info. 

TODO: 
 - Tidy up the files in the repo so that the website ones are selfcontained away from the docs ('instructions'). 
 - Rename the docs dir?
 - Make the locations of all the necessary resources easier to find. 
 - Where is the slideshow? That was really good? is there a link to it?
 - Add a basic cheatsheet.md of common commands.
 - Add a terminology cheatsheet to refer to? common terms and what they mean?
 - Move the answers to a separate answers.md page.
 - Get someone to test the practical and get feedback.
